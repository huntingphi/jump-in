# Jump-in: The quickest way to jump in to development

 Jump-in automates the creation of folder structures for new projects and creates a new git repository with the option to set an existing remote repo as upstream.
 
 Folder stucture can be specified in the config.yml and different folder structures can be specified for different languages.
 
 For now only C++ is supported, but the aim is to allow users to add their own project-type labels and have a different folder structure for each project type.

## Installing

The package can be installed with ```npm install -g @jethrojm/jump-in```

## Getting started

To start a new project open terminal run ```jump-in```. Then simply follow the terminal prompts.

Edit the folder structure in the config.yml to change what folders are created.
